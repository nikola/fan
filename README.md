### fan

A movie compilation and playback app for Windows. Fast. Lean. No weather widget. [See it in action!]

**Key features:**

* Browse your movie compilation in a highly interactive, fluid grid view, or switch to the detail browser with additional information about each movie.
* Find and access movies with hotkeys. Sort by title, rating, release year, budget, and more. Show the English title, or switch to the original title on-the-fly. *(Support for more UI languages coming soon!)*
* Watch YouTube trailers for each movie within _fan_, no separate browser needed.
* _fan_ automagically:
    * scans one or more drives for MKV movie files, and imports metadata, posters and backdrops from [The Movie Database (TMDb)], the #1 source for up-to-date movie information and artwork.
    * downscales poster artwork from the original full-resolution images at ultra-high quality (using EWA RobidouxSharp)
    * detects when a movie belongs to a collection, and displays collections as expandable grids for a very compact overview of vast movie libraries.
    * installs best-of-breed third-party software for high-quality playback: [MPC-HC], [madVR] and [LAV Filters] \(not bundled with _fan_\).
